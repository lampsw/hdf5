 * This example creates a group in the file and dataset in the group.
 * Hard link to the group object is created and the dataset is accessed
 * under different names.
 * Iterator function is used to find the object names in the root group.
 * Note that the C++ API iterator function is not completed yet, thus
 * the C version is used in this example.
